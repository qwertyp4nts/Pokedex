# Pokedex
Pokedex Android app

Pokedex app created in Android Studio. It uses the Android development framework (widgets and intents), Java, SQL and the pokeapi.co to retreive Pokemon information via API calls.

This was an assignment for Harvard's CS50. The app was created through a video walkthrough, and I implemented the following functionalities for the assignment:
- Filter pokemon by name (using Filterable interface)
- Catch and release pokemon via button
- Remember app state between program executions (using SharedPreferences class)
- Add Pokemon image (Fetch from API and display inline on Pokemon screen)
- Add Pokemon description (Fetch from API and display inline on Pokemon screen)
- Style the app and change the layouts via xml files. 
- Add dynamic text to display when the app is loading content from the API
